# Challenge

**Consigna:**

Create a React.js app that reads the following JSON file and generates a survey app interface (like Google Forms) for each item.

In terms of design and aesthetics, it should be different from Google Forms. You can use any library you deem necessary.

Survey responses must be sent to a Firebase database that you own. Do not share access to the database with us.

Finally, retrieve the responses from the aforementioned database and display them in the same app but on a different route. When the "submit" button is pressed on the form, a message should appear with access to the route where the responses are located. Design and aesthetics are up to personal preference.

**Technologies:**
* Vite
* React
* Material UI
* Firebase
* React-router
* Sass

**To run the project on a local server, clone the repository and then run the following commands:**
```
npm install
npm run dev

```
